### Welcome 👋
This is my extension built with Buildspace's project [build your own AI writing assistant w/ GPT-3](https://buildspace.so/builds/ai-writer) project. 

<hr>

<h3>Install<h3>
1. Clone this repo to your machine (or download the zip file).

2. In your chromium based browser, go to the extensions page and hit the toggle to turn on developer mode

3. click on "load unpacked" and navigate into the root of this directory and hit select

4. input your OpenAI API key when prompted, and then use the browser context menus to use the extension

**This works best to use this extension to generate tweets in a third party editor such as Calmly right now, but soon will be able to generate directly in twitter**

LMK if you have any input!!! 💪🏼💪🏼💪🏼
